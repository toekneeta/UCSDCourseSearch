        <p>Hello, this website is designed by UCSD undergraduate data science students Misa Franknedy and Tony Ta as part of their data science capstone project. 
            The goal of this website is to elevate the student experience when searching for courses to take. 
            This search engine improves upon WebReg's search function, which is restricted to searching for only exact matches on the course title, 
            by utilizing semantic search to make searching for classes more flexible. Feel free to search for any topics you're interested in and 
            further refine your searches with our filters!</p>
        
        <h3>Here's some tips on using our search:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Highlighted courses are offered Spring 2024.</li>
            <li>For each search result, its CAPES can be found by clicking the course code.</li>
            <li>Rate the relevance of search results with the thumbs up/down buttons.</li>
            <li>Filtering by departments is case-insensitive (just make sure department codes are spelled correctly and separated by commas).</li>
            <li>You can search by course code (but results will only be returned for exact matches)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Things to come:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>General UI improvements.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Disclaimer: The course availability on this website may not reflect all courses offered at UCSD. If there are any discrepancies in course offerings (or for any general feedback), please let us know in Feedback!</p>
