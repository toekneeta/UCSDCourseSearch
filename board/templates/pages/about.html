        <p>Hello, this website is designed to be a semantic search for UCSD classes! Feel free to search for any topics you're interested in and further refine your searches with our filters!</p>
        
        <h3>Here's some tips on using our search:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Highlighted courses are offered Spring 2024.</li>
            <li>For each search result, its CAPES can be found by clicking the course code.</li>
            <li>Rate the relevance of search results with the thumbs up/down buttons.</li>
            <li>Filtering by departments is case-insensitive (just make sure department codes are spelled correctly and separated by commas).</li>
            <li>You can search by course code (but results will only be returned for exact matches)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Things to come:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>General UI improvements.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Disclaimer: The course availability on this website may not reflect all courses offered at UCSD. If there are any discrepancies in course offerings (or for any general feedback), please let us know in Feedback!</p>
